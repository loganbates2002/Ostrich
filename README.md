# A Modern Interpretation of the Jurassic


 View/download the model I made here:

I used the 3d scanned T-rex skeleton from the Smithsonian's website but played around with the positioning, the placement of the arms, and lowered the polygon count drastically. https://3d.si.edu/object/3d/tyrannosaurus-and-triceratops:d8c62d28-4ebc-11ea-b77f-2e728ce88125

The website uses the GLTF Loader from Three.js to load and display the 3d model.
